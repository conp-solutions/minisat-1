MergeSat (EDA-AI version), Norbert Manthey, Johannes Fichte, 2021

This package contains tools to solve CNF formulas with MergeSat.

## Quick Start

The following steps allow to solve a CNF INPUT_FILE:

```
./build.sh                               # run once
./binary/run_config*.sh "$INPUT_FILE"    # run selected configuration on CNF
```

## MergeSat in the EDA AI package

This package contains several configurations of the MergeSat solver. Each
configuration package wlil select a single one. Hence, the instructions in this
README file are generic, especially the step to solve the CNF.
